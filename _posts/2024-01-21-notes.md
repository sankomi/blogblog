## `_config.yml`

### `permalink: pretty`

Sets url to `/:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title/`

(Added to remove `.html` in page urls)

### `defaults`

Set default front matter within scopes

For example,

```
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "post"
      author: "sanko"
```

Will set `layout: post` and `author: sanko` for all `posts`

## SCSS

Import file cant have same name as main file

i.e. can't `@import "style";` inside `assets/css/style.scss`
